I participated at the [Doctoral Students Work][1] organized by my [University][5]. I presented a [poster][6] about my recent work on how to generate data to train neural networks for a more robust source separation, in the case of classical music. This poster is based on the paper we submitted to the SMC conference and the code, data and models I published in [github][2] and zenodo. It seems that the University (through the library) hosts a [repository][4], so I will backup some stuff there.

I shared the [open science award][3] with another researcher from the department, Monica Dominguez, who works on natural language processing.

Although I have less time now, with the deadline to deliver the thesis approaching, I will make sure code and data are accessible and explained well, so other people can use it.
