The South American news channel NTN24 asked me to talk about the[PHENICX][1] project and orchestral music source separation. This interview follows up the journal article we published last year (December 2016) and the [dataset][2] associated with it:

{% include alert text='M. Miron, J. Carabias-Orti, J. J. Bosch, E. GÃ³mez and J. Janer, "Score-informed source separation for multi-channel orchestral recordings", Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (2016))"' %}

They presented the prototype done by VideoDock and talked about non-negative matrix factorization (is this the first time NMF appears in the mainstream media? :) )

PHENICX source separation has been already in the news (in Spanish, Catalan and Romanian) in February 2017. Read more [here][3].
