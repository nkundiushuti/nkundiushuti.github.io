Currently, I work for the [Earth Species Project][9] as a Senior AI Research Scientist. My research area is machine learning for biology applications, in particular bioacoustics. I train generative large language models and develop signal processing methods to help biologists decode animal communication.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Researcher for Music Technology Group, Pompeu Fabra University. I lead research projects, supervised PhD, Masters students and other researchers. I contributed to the overall activities and goals of the MTG. In particular, I collaborated at writing project proposals, I advised a few industrial-transfer project related to audio source separation, audio fingerprinting, music classification, version identification. In addition, I taught the Music Information Retrieval class at the Sound and Music Computing Masters.

I was a Postdoctoral researcher for European Commission's Joint Research Centre within the project [HUMAINT][6] on Explainability and Fairness in Machine Learning. I have a PhD (2018) in Computer Science (Audio Signal Processing and Machine Learning) from Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona.

In 2018 I defended my PhD at [Music Technology Group][2], Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona as a part of an European FP7 project which was aiming at transforming the way classical music is enjoyed. My [PhD thesis][3] concerned separating the audio corresponding to the instruments in an orchestral music mixture. I gave a new flavour to the topic by proposing a deep learning approach.

I have completed internships at Computational Perception Group, Johannes Kepler University, Linz where I started my work on deep learning for source separation, and at Telefonica Research, Barcelona, where I gave a more general flavour to my research career working on catastrophic forgetting in machine learning ([ICML 2018 paper][7])

My journey in research started in 2010. Having more than 6 years experience as a software engineer, in 2010 I gave a new start to my career by moving to Barcelona to start a Master's in signal processing and machine learning applied to music. Then I worked as a Research engineer for the research institute [INESC][4] in Porto, where I was involved in a project aiming at modelling groove, and I developed a few real-time tools for audio analysis and transformation.

I [code][5] in Python and C++, mainly using open source library and I try to publish everything I do as open source. I aim at making my work transparent and reproducible, so I can foster knowledge, development, and creativity.
